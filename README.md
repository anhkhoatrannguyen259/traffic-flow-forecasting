Traffic Flow Forecasting using Multivariate Time-Series Deep Learning and Distributed Computing
Traffic flow prediction is one of the most important and challenging problems. In this study, we built several univariate and multivariate time series models including LSTM, TCN, Seq2Seq, NBeats, ARIMA and Prophet using distributed deep learning to deal with the traffic flow prediction problem. The models are implemented and their performances were evaluated on a dataset of traffic flows in Ireland. The proposed multivariate models take the combination of traffic flow data, weather in the local area, and graph data of connections between traffic positions to produce the prediction of the traffic flow. The experimental results show that the proposed multivariate deep learning models achieved better prediction accuracy compared to the univariate models and machine learning models. Several other experiments were also conducted to examine the performances of these models in different scenarios to help understand more about the performance of these models.
